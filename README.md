# Cura settings for Flashforge Adventurer 3

Installation Instructions

Since I'm using windows, other operating systems don't know the correct location.
Copy the "Flasforge_Adventurer-3_Cura_Definition" "recourses" and "plugin" directory to the Cura installation location.
For example:
Windows 10:  C:\Program Files\Ultimaker Cura 4.8.0\

Other operating systems must also have the same folder somewhere.
\Ultimaker Cura 4.8.0\

The printer appears under the "Flasforge" manufacturer.
The profile has now been changed to match the Dreamer NX profile that appears in Cura 4.9. 
This makes it easier to add the printer to Cura later when the profile works.

If you first test then use a generic PLA, ABS or PETG profile. Dreamer NX print speeds are added to these materials. 
What is otherwise Flashprint's initial settings are the same as Adventurer 3 speeds. Although I've changed the speeds to improve printing.

# Added Ronoaldo .GX plugin.
